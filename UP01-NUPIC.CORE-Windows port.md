"Readyness potential" w.r.t. cortical waves (resetting signals)
SAI (or SSI) and/or NAI into SimpleFlow?
Quadratic enough for derivative tracking?
Henson, Dieter, Parabrachial cells, cap of Kooy (MAO?)
CF36 PROPERTY!!
BT & Sky

18th -
17:00 start with initial conference call. Outlining ideas for 6+ routes to take. Narrow down to 3/4 achievable directions to investigate.

19th - 
AppVeyor updates (VS90, dist_utils)

20th -
New GH Issues. Faking VS140.

21st - 
Scott update. Main issue defined. Email ready for ML, but awaiting less movement between NuPIC and Core before sending.

22nd - 
Challenge Event

24th -
Updating Core and NuPIC with latest. Brief look at Random::shuffle and if it is a correct port of the Merseinne Twist (MT, sp?). TM diffs after update.
