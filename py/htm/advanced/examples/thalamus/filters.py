    """Return complex 2D Gabor filter kernel.

    Gabor kernel is a Gaussian kernel modulated by a complex harmonic function.
    Harmonic function consists of an imaginary sine function and a real
    cosine function. Spatial frequency is inversely proportional to the
    wavelength of the harmonic and to the standard deviation of a Gaussian
    kernel. The bandwidth is also inversely proportional to the standard
    deviation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frequency : float
        Spatial frequency of the harmonic function. Specified in pixels.
    theta : float, optional
        Orientation in radians. If 0, the harmonic is in the x-direction.
    bandwidth : float, optional
        The bandwidth captured by the filter. For fixed bandwidth, `sigma_x`
        and `sigma_y` will decrease with increasing frequency. This value is
        ignored if `sigma_x` and `sigma_y` are set by the user.
    sigma_x, sigma_y : float, optional
        Standard deviation in x- and y-directions. These directions apply to
        the kernel *before* rotation. If `theta = pi/2`, then the kernel is
        rotated 90 degrees so that `sigma_x` controls the *vertical* direction.
    n_stds : scalar, optional
        The linear size of the kernel is n_stds (3 by default) standard
        deviations
    offset : float, optional
        Phase offset of harmonic function in radians.

    Returns
    -------
    g : complex array
        Complex filter kernel.
