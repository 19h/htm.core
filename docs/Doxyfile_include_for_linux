# This file is intended to be included in the Doxyfile config for Linux.
# It contains configuration settings that are incompatible with Windows.

# The FILTER_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify filters on a per file pattern
# basis. Doxygen will compare the file name with each pattern and apply the
# filter if there is a match. The filters are a list of the form: pattern=filter
# (like *.cpp=my_cpp_filter). See INPUT_FILTER for further information on how
# filters are used. If the FILTER_PATTERNS tag is empty or if none of the
# patterns match the file name, INPUT_FILTER is applied.
#
# Note that we currently have to use a patched version of doxypypy.py because of
# new syntax in python version 3.8.
# See https://github.com/Feneric/doxypypy/issues/70
# The patched version is stored in the current directory.
