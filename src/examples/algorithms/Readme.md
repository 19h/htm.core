# C++ NuPIC HelloWorld example

This file serves two purposes: 

## Demo C++ aplication 

Using only C++ `nupic.core` implementations, currently the chain uses 
` SpatialPooler > TemporalPooler` 

More classes should be added as they are ported (Encoders, Classifier, Anomaly, ...)

## Profiling code 

For ongoing optimization goals, we need a simple but complete code to run benchmarks and profile. 
You can easily change the constants (`EPOCHS, DIM,...`) and try this code on your branch.
